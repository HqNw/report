# 1 computers.
 its just a some hardware mashed together that takes an input and processes it with the help of the instructions that the  software provides.
 the input can be taken from a mouse keyboard etc...
 the output can be outputted to a screen, a speaker and the list goes on.
 the speed of the computer is usually determent by its size the bigger the faster and so on.
 but in the end computers are just their to do the stuff that is repetitive or will just take a lot of time and energy.
# 2 operating systems 
 operating systems are the ones that does the heavy lifting from managing computer resources to making the communication between software and hardware easy.
### gen 1
they didn't start with the same maturity of the today's operating system but they had a simple start.
with the first gen being not that exciting,every device had its own parameters ,and they wore hard to work with.
### gen 2
the second gen however started with gm research producing the first operating system under the name of "IBM 704 computing system".
then came the "embedded operating systems" and the "real-time operating systems" that was fast and  more stable and can resume tasks after crashes.
they were good enough to use in rockets and air traffic controls.
### gen 3
now, here where the fun starts with the appearance of "batch file operating systems"
and "network operating systems".
they were fast ,scalable , accurate and had the ability to communicate securely in a network.
then came unix the first os that can be installed on multiple and allowed for processor time sharing  which allowed for multiple users to work on the same device at the same time
### gen 4
this is where the computers and operating systems started drag racing with no one 
hardware became fast and operating systems started to get better and better with the rise of windows being built on dos , linux and macOs being built on unix plus  Chrome os and android being built on linux introducing multitasking 
## installing an operating system
### preinstalled 
most of the time that's the norm , you just go with the installation wizard and follow with it 
### self install
that would be you if you are an "IT technician" or you just built your own PC
every system has its own way but the basics are:
- obtain the desired os iso 
- burn it to a usb 
- attach it to your device 
- open your bios and change your boot drive to your usb
- save the changes and follow with the operating system way of installation

### after install (windows)
after installing lets say windows you can use the task manager to manage and view running processes because apps freeze or crash some times
if you want to know if your hardware and drivers are working, you can search for device manager and launch it you can look for the thing you need and make sure its working and manipulate its settings 
### drivers 
drivers are the software that allows your system and the device to communicate 
if you have any problem try to update drivers before inspecting your device
### utils 
**windows memory diagnostics**
locates hardware memory errors 
**windows event viewer**
provides logs to help with diagnostics 
**windows task manager**
manages tasks

### disk configs 
there are some partition types 
- FAT32
- NTFS (windows default)
- HPFS
- EXT4 (linux/unix default)
- HFS (mac default)

you might want to manage your storage for maximum performance and minamalize data loss and usage

### communication protocols 
- http
- tcp
	allows apps to talk with each others. 
- udp
	keeps the connection alive.
- irc


# 3 computing devices 
## stationary devices 
they consist of the typical hardware 
- motherboard
- cpu
- ram
- storage
- gpu (not all the time)
- and slots for upgrades
### work stations 
they are built in boxes that are relatively hard to move.
they usually use windows, mac or linux
### servers
they are installed in batches either above or next to each others to allow for high speed communication and act as media holders.
they also house most of the websites we use today.
they provide redundancy most of the time.
they use really robust operating systems to allow for this level of speed and power like
- linux (used most if not all of the time)
- windows server
- unix
- mac os x
- freeBSD
### gaming consoles 
they contain 
- cpu
- gpu
- ram
- input/output ports 
- mem controllers 
 they are similar to work stations but are geared more towards games and they are not upgradable 

## mobile devices 
they are built to try and match the stationary systems but with portability in mind,the smaller the less performance , that includes your 
- laptop 
- tablet 
- phone 
- portable gaming devices
## IOT devices
they are specific purpose devices like
- cameras 
- home automation devices
- trackers
- wearables
- TVs
- etc......
	they can communicate through wifi ,nfc ,bluetooth , etc....
consumer, enterprise and industrial devices exist and they are highly specialized


# 4 computer communications 
## notational systems 
### decimal
this the the system that we (humans) use 
the base 10 system 
from 1 to 10 and between
### binary
this on the other hand is the low level language of a computer 
it only has two numbers 0 and 1 as of true and false
its called "bits" but we work most of the time with "bytes"
### hexadecimal
we usually use "hex" to describe it.
its a base 16 system that uses **0** though **9** and letters **A** though **F** to reach 15

## data types 
- char
	- ASCII
- UNICODE
	- utf-8
	- utf-16
	- utf-32

- string
- integers (int)
- floats
- boolean (bool)

# 5 computer's speed
## processor's speed
they are measured in hertz.
but today that wont keep up so we use gigahertz (GHz)

## bus types and speeds
are the data high ways and are located on the processor back around the main dye 
there are three types of buses 
- address bus 
- data bus
- control bus

## cores
cores are inside of the processor 
we can go up to 64 cores in one processor but most consumer grade processors have 2 to 8 some times 16 cores 
## cache
cache can speed up the task by caching the most frequently used data to high speed memory on the processor it self
## storage 
- hdd (hard disk drive) 
- ssd (solid state drive)
- portable flash memory
- hyprid
## random access memory (RAM)
is another way of caching data but slower than the processor's cache
but that doesn't mean that its slow its getting faster and faster everyday
it also handles temporary tasks or running tasks like web browsing
we all know the famous windows "blue screen" that can be triggered by your device running out of memory  
## network speed
- bps | b/s
- kbps | kb/s
- Mbps | mb/s 
- Gbps | gb/s
- Tbps | tb/s
# 6 computer components (hardware)
### cpu
its like the brain it does all the math and gives instructions to the other components
### motherboard
its the heart of the computer that connects everything together
### ram 
its the short term memory its fast but if it losses power every thing on it gets wiped 
### hard drive
its the long term memory of the computer it can store data even when power is lost
## peripherals
they are the outside hands the helpers as you might say you can be input devices or an output device like
- mouse 
- keyboard
- printer 
- monitor
- etc...
	they use connectors or plugs as some might call that connects to a port in the computer 
### output devices 
they are the way that the computer talks to us like 
- monitors 
- speakers
- projectors
- etc...
#### printers
- laser
- inkjet
- thermal
	some printers can connect to networks and be used from the network
#### scanners 
converts anything you scan to a digital image format
#### fax
is just a scanner and a printer that can send and receive massages from other faxes 
### input devices 
they are the way we talk to the computer or the way it listens to us like
- keyboard
- mouse
- touchpad
- camera
- joystick
- pointing device
### hard drives
they store data in form of bits or bytes for latter use 
#### read only memory
or as called "ROM", it can only be read and is used to boot up the computer and it can retain data when power is lost
#### random access memory
"RAM"
it is volatile, that means if it losses power it wont retain its data
#### hard drives/disks
they store data using magnetism 
there exists some types like 
- sata
- pata
### optical drives 
they use lasers to burn into the disk to make highs and lows and they have some types like
- CD-ROM
- CD-RW
- DVD-ROM
- DVD-RW
- Blu-ray
	 they are read by a laser
### solid state drive
"SSD" it stores data in the form of electrons which eliminates the mechanical parts of the hard drives allowing them to be super fast
#### flash drives 
they are the fanciness of an ssd with a usb interface 
they are small and light hints the name "thumb drive"
#### memory cards
they are smaller than a thumb drives and are used in their cases

### display device 
its the way the computer shows us something like and image or a video or text and there are types of display devices 
- crt
- lcd
- tft
- projectors 
### audio device
they are the mouth of the computer they allow the computer to produce sound
they connect to the sound card that is most of the time backed into the motherboard
#### headphones
they are the way your phone can talk to you privately without anyone hearing 
they most of the time use 3.5mm jack
